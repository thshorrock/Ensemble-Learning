/**
 * @mainpage Ensemble Learning Documentation
 * @author Tom Shorrock (t.h.shorrock@gmail.com)
 * @date  June, 2011
 * @section purpose_sec Purpose
 * 
 * Provide a cross platform c++ library for Inference by Variational Ensemble Learning.
 *
 *
 * @section example_sec Example:
 *
 *  See the list of examples.  The source code is found in the example folder.
 *
 * \section feature_sec Feature
 * A swig interface file is provided for this library.
 * This means that a wrapper to the c++ library is easily created for any of the following languages:
 * - AllegroCL
 * - C# - Mono
 * - C# - MS .NET
 * - CFFI
 * - CHICKEN
 * - CLISP
 * - Go language
 * - Guile
 * - Java
 * - Lua
 * - MzScheme
 * - Ocaml
 * - Octave (and Matlab via Octave)
 * - Perl
 * - PHP
 * - Python
 * - R
 * - Ruby
 * - Tcl/Tk
 *
 *
 * \section dependancies_sec Dependancies.
 *  This library uses the Boost c++ libraries and the GNU Scientific Library.
 * 
 * \section git_repo_sec Location of the Repository
 * 
 * The library source code is stored in a git repository.
 * 
 * The Git repository is located at 
 * @verbatim  git@github.com:thshorrock/Ensemble-Learning.git  @endverbatim
 * To clone the repository type in a terminal ( or in the git bash terminal if you are using windows):
 * @code
 * git clone  git@github.com:thshorrock/Ensemble-Learning.git
 * @endcode
 * This will install a folder called "EnsembleLearning" at the location in which you typed the command.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * \section installation_sec Installation
 * 
 * This library is most conveniently installed with cmake, although Bjam may also be used.
 * 
 *  - cmake is a meta-build tool.  It builds the local build tool for your system (for example linux make files, or Microsoft Visual Studio project files).
 *  - Bjam is a cross platform installation tool.
 *
 * @section licence_sec Licence
 * 
 * The library is licensed under the GPL, available for download: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/.
 * 
 * Since the library uses the Boost c++ libraries, the Boost lisence also applies.
 *

 * @example InferData1.cpp
 *  In this example 20 data points are drawn at random from a Gaussian distribution
 *  with a mean equal to 3 and a precision (the inverse of the variance) equal to 10.
 *
 *  The distribution from which the data points were sampled is inferred from the data.
 *
 *  The generated data points are as plotted.
 * @image html data_points.png
 * @image latex  data_points.eps  "data points"
 *
 *  The data is modelled (correctly) as being Gaussian distrubuted. 
 *  The mean and precision of the Gaussian are inferred from the data.
 *  The prior knowledge assumed on the mean and precision is fairly non-commital,
 *  as is seen from the plots.
 * @image html priors.png
 * @image latex  priors.eps  "Prior distributions for the mean and precision"
 *  
 *  Nevertheless, the inferred mean and precision is dominated by the 20 data points.
 *   - The inferred mean is  \f$ 3.012 \pm 0.078 \f$
 *   - The inferred precision is \f$ 8.14 \pm 2.45 \f$
 *
 * @example InferMixture1.cpp
 *  In this example 500 data points are drawn at random from three different
 * Gaussian distributions, with
 *   - mean equal to 3 and precision 10,
 *   - mean equal to 6 and precision 6,
 *   - mean equal to 3 and precision 2
 *
 *  The distribution from which the data points were sampled is inferred from the data.
 *
 *  The generated data points are as plotted.
 * @image html data_points.png
 * @image latex  data_points.eps  "data points"
 *
 *  The data is modelled  as being taken from a mixture of 5 Gaussian distrubutions
 *  The mean, precision and weight of each distribution  are inferred from the data.
 *  The prior knowledge assumed on the mean and precision is fairly non-commital,
 *  as is seen from the plots.
 * @image html priors.png
 * @image latex  priors.eps  "Prior distributions for the mean and precision"
 *  
 *  The inferred weights for  500  data points are drawn in the table, the cost is  -1.40356.
